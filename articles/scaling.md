longtitle: I Will Never Ever Scale Pronoun&shy;mail Dot Com, So Help Me God

Greetings Homosexuals, this is my statement of intent: Once pronounmail.com
reaches 250 users, I will turn off registration, and there's nothing you can do
to stop me. This isn't to say that'll ever happen—it probably won't—but it's
there in case we need it.

The reasons for this are twofold:

- I would not be able to deal with the strain that catering for 251+ people
  would put on me. I am a busy-ish student and sometimes I need to log off for
  the sake of not developing some sort of funny brain disease.

- We need smaller and tigher-knit communities in order to cultivate the kind of
  strange, diverse and deeply personal projects you very much love to see on the web.
  Sites like Neocities have made great strides in this department,
  but I think they lack the community aspect necessary to prevent people from
  just making a few edits, getting stuck and retreating back to X: The
  Everything App. \
  I have recently come to learn that it is, in fact, incredibly
  fulfilling to provide the support and resources needed to help friends make
  their own fun internet webpages, and I'd very much like to encourage you give
  that a go yourself, even if you end up being utterly shit at it.

If you happen to be in the market for setting up your own web hosting thing, I
will tell you that Pronounmail takes nearly all of its cues from members of the
[tildeverse](https://tildeverse.org/), a group of public access unix systems. I
learnt the majority of what I know about computers today from messing around on
various tilde systems, and I appreciate everyone involved in running them
immensely. Use spaces like these as a base for your own funny online friend
group, and I hope it goes exceedingly well for you.

That all for today, I apologise for being sincere on the internet, if it helps I
will almost certainly find this post very embarrassing a few months from now.
