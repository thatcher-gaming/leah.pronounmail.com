        this is a list of web pages i think are cool and or fun. now that every
        search engine is useless, writing this page this constitutes heroism.

    <h2>worlb wibe web</h2>

    <p>you should have a website, i think! here are some cool resources for doing that:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <a target="_blank" href="https://neocities.org">neocities</a> is the webhost of choice for many.
            it comes with a web-based html editor and so on. it's pretty good!
        </li>
        <li>
            every <a target="_blank" href="https://pronounmail.com">pronounmail</a> account comes with
            free web hosting. i would call this shameless self-promotion but i am actively losing money
            on this.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">MDN</a>
            has a pretty good
            <a target="_blank"
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics">HTML
                guide</a>, as well as containing all the reference material you could ever need.
        </li>
        <li>
            i would advise steering clear of "w3schools".
            their materials are still chock-full of straight up misinformation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a target="_blank" href="https://fonts.google.com">Google Fonts</a> has many free fonts you can use with
            abadon. i'm pretty sure this is the last cool thing google still supports.
        </li>
    </ul>
